British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage - December 2023

 * Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component
   of British Airways success
 * Scraped and analysed customer review data to uncover findings
 * Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying
   behaviour

“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in British Airway's job simulation on the Forage
platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to
participate on a Data Science team at British Airways.
I worked on a project where I analysed customer insights and built predictive
model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour. I practiced my data
analytics skills using a Jupyter Notebook and built my PowerPoing and
communication skills by presenting insights a real-world context.
Doing this programme confirmed that I really enjoy working with data to provide
business insights and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Data Science team
at a company like British Airways.
